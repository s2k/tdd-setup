# tdd-setup

Initial setup of a #Ruby project that uses RSpec for TDDing & guard to automatically run the unit tests when the file system changes.

I created this, while working on [J. B. Rainsberger's (@jbrains)](https://twitter.com/jbrains) "The World's Best Intro to TDD" online course -> https://online-training.jbrains.ca/p/wbitdd-01
